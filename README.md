# ModManager
A mod manager inspired by Mod Organiser that can non-destructively handle files in the root directory of a game with a drag and drop mod order.

## Planned Features:
### Profiles:
Seperate profiles for different mod lists via managing:
- Saves, settings, etc. in "%userprofile%/My Games/Skyrim"
- Plugin order, etc. in "%localappdata%/Skyrim Special Edition"

### Mod Order Sorting:
- Drag and Drop
- Conflict information via symbols and contextual highlighting
- Note Taking
- Versioning

### Plugin Order Sorting:
- Drag and Drop
- Dependency information via symbols and contextual highlighting

## Wishful Features:
- Cross-Platform Support (Linux and Windows)
- Support multiple games
